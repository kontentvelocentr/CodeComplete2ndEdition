## Laying the Foundation

__Chapter 1: Welcome to Software Construction__

_What is software construction?_

Software construction involves: 

1. Problem definition
2. Requirements development, detailed design, corrective maintenance
3. Constructive planning, **coding and debugging**, integration, integration testing
4. Software architecture, unit testing, system testing

Although software construction is mostly coding and debugging, it also involves detailed design, construction planning, unit testing, integration, integration testing, and other activities.

Specific tasks involved in construction: 

1. Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed
successfully
2. Designing and writing classes and routines
3. Creating and naming variables and named constants
4. Selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
5. Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
6. Reviewing other team members' low-level designds and coding and having them review yours
7. Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it
8. Integrating software components that were created seperately
9. Tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources

_What's the significance behind software construction?_

* Construction is a large part of software development.
* Construction is the central acvitity in software development. 
  * Requirements and architecture are done before construction so that you can do construction effectively. System testing (in the strict sense of independent testing) is done after construction to verify that construction has been done correctly. Construction is at the center of the software-development process.
* With a focus in construction, the individual programmer's productivity can improve enormously. 
* Construction’s product, the source code, is often the only accurate description of the software.
* __Construction is the only activity that’s guaranteed to be done__
